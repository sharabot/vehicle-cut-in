# "VEHICLE CUT-IN DETECTION"

## OVERVIEW :

Vehicle cut-in detection is a crucial aspect of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. It involves detecting and predicting the sudden appearance or movement of a vehicle into the driving lane from adjacent lanes. This capability enhances road safety by allowing timely and appropriate responses from the vehicle's control system

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: Vehicle Cut-in Detection

## SOLUTION:

Detecting vehicle cut-ins is crucial for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. A cut-in scenario typically involves a vehicle moving into your lane from an adjacent lane, often suddenly. By using machine learning and python with real time equipments.
